### Question: 

What is the origin of the forty-day anniversary?

### Answer: 

The origin of this is a Pharaonic custom which was practised by the Pharaohs before Islam, then it spread from them to other nations. It is a reprehensible bid'ah which has no basis in Islam, and it is be rejected as the Prophet ﷺ said: **“Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours (Islam) which is not a part of it, will have it rejected.”** (Sahih – agreed upon).
